# TechStack Explorer - AI Tool Compatibility Matrix

## Overview
TechStack Explorer is a compatibility matrix database module for the StackFast platform. It provides an interactive system to analyze relationships between development tools, forming the data foundation for tech stack recommendations. Key capabilities include a dynamic tool database fed by external sources, compatibility scoring, comparison functionality, analytics for AI coding tools, and real-time API integration for data updates. The project aims to enhance StackFast's ability to recommend optimal tech stacks based on tool interoperability.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Core Design
- **Purpose**: Interactive compatibility matrix for tech stack recommendations.
- **Data Source Prioritization**: Emphasizes curated external sources (Back4App, Product Hunt) over raw GitHub data for higher quality tool identification.
- **Intelligent Tool Identification**: Filters out non-tool entries (programming languages, book collections, resource lists) to ensure the matrix contains actual development tools.
- **Compatibility Generation**: Automates compatibility scoring based on tool metadata, category-based rules, and known tool relationships.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle thousands of tools with optimized performance for compatibility matrix generation.

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript.
- **Routing**: Wouter.
- **UI Library**: Radix UI components with shadcn/ui styling.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables, featuring a neon orange accent and GitHub-inspired dark theme.
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management and caching.
- **Build Tool**: Vite.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach.
- **User Interface**: Features a dashboard homepage displaying statistics, categories, and popular tools; a Stack Builder for stack validation and harmony scoring; a Compare Tools section; and a Tool Database with advanced search and external data source management. The compatibility matrix operates primarily in the background to power recommendations.

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js.
- **Language**: TypeScript with ESM modules.
- **API Design**: RESTful API with structured route handlers.
- **Data Layer**: Abstracted storage interface, with Drizzle ORM for PostgreSQL.
- **API Integration System**: Modular service with provider-specific adapters (GitHub, npm, Docker Hub, OpenAI, Stripe, Vercel) for dynamic tool discovery and data mapping.
- **External Data Sources System**: Service for importing tools from Back4App, GitHub, npm, and Product Hunt, including features for batch import, dry run, and automatic categorization.

### Database
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect.
- **Schema**: `toolCategories`, `tools`, and `compatibilities` tables. `tool_category_junction` table for many-to-many relationships between tools and categories.
- **Data Types**: JSONB fields for flexible array storage.
- **Migrations**: Managed through Drizzle Kit.

### API Endpoints
