# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for improving the Stackfast codebase based on a comprehensive analysis. The application is currently 95% functional with most features working correctly. However, there are several areas for improvement including bug fixes, performance optimizations, security enhancements, and code quality improvements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Compatibility Matrix Edit Functionality

**User Story:** As a developer using the compatibility matrix, I want to be able to edit tool compatibility relationships directly from the matrix view, so that I can maintain accurate compatibility data efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the edit button in the compatibility matrix THEN the system SHALL open an edit dialog for the compatibility relationship
2. WHEN a user submits valid compatibility data THEN the system SHALL update the compatibility record in the database
3. WHEN a compatibility is successfully updated THEN the system SHALL refresh the matrix view and show a success notification
4. IF the update fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2: Implement Performance Optimizations

**User Story:** As a user browsing large datasets, I want the application to load and respond quickly, so that I can work efficiently without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the compatibility matrix loads with more than 50 tools THEN the system SHALL use virtualization to maintain smooth scrolling
2. WHEN API responses are cached THEN the system SHALL serve subsequent identical requests from cache within 5 minutes
3. WHEN large tool lists are displayed THEN the system SHALL implement pagination with configurable page sizes
4. WHEN search queries are performed THEN the system SHALL debounce input to avoid excessive API calls

### Requirement 3: Enhance Security and Input Validation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to be secure against common vulnerabilities, so that user data and system integrity are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any user input is received THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize all inputs using Zod schemas
2. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
3. WHEN database queries are executed THEN the system SHALL use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
4. WHEN file uploads are processed THEN the system SHALL validate file types and sizes

### Requirement 4: Improve Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs in any API endpoint THEN the system SHALL log the error with appropriate context
2. WHEN a user encounters an error THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
3. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement proper error boundaries in React components
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide structured logging with different log levels

### Requirement 5: Code Quality and Maintainability Improvements

**User Story:** As a developer working on the codebase, I want clean, well-organized code, so that I can easily understand, modify, and extend the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN large components exist THEN the system SHALL break them down into smaller, focused components
2. WHEN duplicate code is found THEN the system SHALL extract common functionality into reusable utilities
3. WHEN TypeScript types are used THEN the system SHALL ensure strict type safety throughout the codebase
4. WHEN new features are added THEN the system SHALL follow consistent patterns and conventions

### Requirement 6: Database and API Optimizations

**User Story:** As a user performing complex operations, I want the system to handle database operations efficiently, so that I experience fast response times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple related data is fetched THEN the system SHALL use efficient joins to minimize database queries
2. WHEN frequently accessed data is requested THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate database indexes
3. WHEN bulk operations are performed THEN the system SHALL use batch processing to improve performance
4. WHEN API responses are large THEN the system SHALL implement compression and efficient serialization

### Requirement 7: Enhanced Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a developer deploying changes, I want comprehensive testing coverage, so that I can be confident in the stability of new releases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN critical business logic is implemented THEN the system SHALL have unit tests with at least 80% coverage
2. WHEN API endpoints are created THEN the system SHALL have integration tests for all endpoints
3. WHEN UI components are built THEN the system SHALL have component tests for user interactions
4. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL pass all automated tests

### Requirement 8: Monitoring and Analytics Improvements

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want insights into application usage and performance, so that I can make data-driven decisions for improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users interact with the application THEN the system SHALL track key usage metrics
2. WHEN performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL monitor and alert on response times and error rates
3. WHEN system resources are consumed THEN the system SHALL track memory and CPU usage
4. WHEN user feedback is needed THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms for collecting user input
